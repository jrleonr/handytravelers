# Hi {{ $user->first_name }},

How many times have you felt that you've lost the magic of places you visited?

Without knowing how... You end up listening over and over again the same stories. And the only thing you want is to be part of the local culture.

Sure you're tired of answering same questions over and over again.

You change location, but..

Experience the same.

If you are like me. You know what is the best part of travelling...

**People**

During my last hitchhiking trip from London to Istanbul I discovered how kind people are.

 So, I create, Handytravelers. A way to find the nice people everywhere you are and stay, work and live with them.

Feel your profile and start using Handytravelers now...
